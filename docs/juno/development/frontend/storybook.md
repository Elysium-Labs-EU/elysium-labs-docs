# Storybook

We use storybook to list all of the general elements and components that are available in Juno.

Visit the [Chromatic here](https://www.chromatic.com/library?appId=62586cc5c8e270003a13772f).

## Stories

For each of the component a story is written. The stories are created inside a file `COMPONENT.stories.tsx` and are added inside the same folder as the component is found.
