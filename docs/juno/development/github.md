## Branches
For each issue/update a branch is created with a descriptive name.
Once a branch is ready to be merged a Pull Request is created, ideally specifying with branch it is closing, via the keywords `closing #BRANCHNAME` in the PR description.

## Issues
All the the items that are worked on in the projects of Juno are required to have an issue ticket connected.
Each ticket describes what the goal is, is assigned if worked on, has labels, is assigned to the `Pre-release React Gmail Minimal` project and is assigned to a `Milestone`.
