# Testing

Testing is an important part of the development process. It helps you to
ensure that your code is working as expected and that it doesn't break.

## Unit tests

We currently do not have any unit tests. We are working on adding them.

## Integration tests

We are using [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for integration tests. You can find the tests in the `cypress` folder.
